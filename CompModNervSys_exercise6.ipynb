They found there was no inward current in choline, not only providing further support for the idea that the inward current was sodium, but also allowing them to calculate the sodium current. We can replicate this experiment by setting the sodium conductance in our model to zero (something they couldn't do at the time). Modern studies of cellular excitability use drugs that can selectively block ion channel conductances, but these hadn't been discovered yet. \n",

We measured the action potential of the squid giant axon, and then we used the voltage clamp technique to measure the membrane currents as a function of fixed voltages. Using similar experimental manipulations to Hodgkin and Huxley, we isolated the sodium and potassium currents *and* conductances. Hodgkin and Huxley presented further evidence that these conductances are *voltage-dependent*, which was a critical discovery on the path to discoverying voltage-gated ion channels, the electrical basis of the nervous system, and biophysical models of the brain. Next exercise, we'll look at how these conductances vary with voltage and how their model predicted the existence AND behavior of voltage-gated ion channels before they'd been discovered"
